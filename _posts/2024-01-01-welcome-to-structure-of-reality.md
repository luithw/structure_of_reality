# Welcome

This is the beginning of my journey—a personal exploration into the fundamental questions that have captivated me for years: What is intelligence? How does it emerge? What is the structure of reality that allows consciousness to exist?

## Why This Journal?

As a Chinese American computer scientist, I've spent years working at the intersection of technology and human thought. But the more I've learned about artificial intelligence and computational systems, the more I've realized how little we truly understand about intelligence itself—whether biological or artificial.

This journal is my attempt to navigate these deep waters, to document my thoughts, questions, and discoveries as I explore:

- The nature of intelligence and consciousness
- How artificial intelligence relates to human cognition
- The fundamental structures that underlie both computation and thought
- The philosophical and practical implications of our AI-driven future

## What to Expect

These posts will be exploratory, sometimes speculative, always curious. I'm not here to provide definitive answers—I'm here to ask better questions and share the journey of seeking understanding.

Some posts will be technical, diving into algorithms and architectures. Others will be philosophical, wrestling with questions of mind and meaning. All will be honest reflections on this quest to understand the origin of intelligence.

## The Journey Begins

I invite you to join me on this journey. Whether you're a fellow computer scientist, a philosopher of mind, an AI researcher, or simply someone curious about the nature of intelligence, I hope you'll find something here that resonates with your own questions and explorations.

Let's navigate to the origin of intelligence together.
