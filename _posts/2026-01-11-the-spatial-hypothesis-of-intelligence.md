# The Spatial Hypothesis of Intelligence

I move, therefore I think. 

This is why the brain exists.
The brain exists because animals need to move.

A striking example is the sea squirt. 
It begins life with a brain, to swim across the ocean.
Once it finds a rock to attach itself to, it stops moving, and digests its own brain for energy.
When the need for navigation is gone, the brain disappears. 

Why do we need a brain in order to move, you might ask.
Because we don't just move randomly. 
Movement is tiring, it expends energy. 
We only move when we have to.

When do animals move?
We usually move because we need to find food.
And we move in order to avoid being food. 
To forage and to avoid predators. 

This is why animals evolved the capability to move. 
The brain evolved to solve three fundamental questions of movement:
1. When to move
2. How to move
3. Where to move to

Intelligence emerged from these computational challenges. 
Animals evolved from tracing simple chemical gradients to developing sophisticated spatial intelligence.

Out of the three fundamental questions of biological intelligence, when, how, and where to move. 
The question of where is the most computationally demanding. 
In order to know where to move, an animal needs to develop an internal map of the environment around it.
This map tells the animal where it is, where the food is, and where home is.

This map can never be static, because the environment is constantly changing. 
This demands the biological brain to learn a map that can dynamically update itself to match the speed of environmental changes.

One of the greatest findings in neuroscience of the 20th century is the discovery of the place cell.
John O'Keefe and Jonathan Dostrovsky discovered that some neurons in the hippocampus only fire when their rats navigate to a specific location in the arena.

Initially, it was not clear whether these neurons were really encoding space, or merely responding to specific sensory cues, movements, or moments in time.
They systematically ruled out these alternatives by showing that place cell firing stays locked to a location even when visual cues, smells, lighting, behavior, or timing change.
The same neuron fires in the same place across different actions, pauses, and delays, yet can completely remap when the environment itself changes.
What remains invariant is not a feature or a sequence, but where the animal is.
This stability revealed the hippocampus as a true spatial map, a coordinate system onto which experience is organized.

This discovery is profound, because it was the first demonstration that a learning system grounds its learning to fixed locations in space, as best as the sensory system can capture.
The biological brain can solve the computationally hard problem of localization in a dynamic environment.

Understanding how place cells emerge was the central question of my PhD thesis.
I built computational models demonstrating that place cells can emerge spontaneously from the computational demand of perspective transformation.
I also showed that these models achieved localization accuracy comparable to smartphone GPS in dynamic real-world environments with pedestrian and vehicle traffic, using vision alone.
I call these Spatial Temporal Reasoning Models. 

My PhD got me thinking deeper about this problem of localization in a dynamic environment.
But localization is only one of the many computational problems that the biological brain must solve to navigate effectively.
You need to know where you are before you can know where to find food or where home is.
But the environment is dynamic, the location of food keeps changing, new threats emerge, familiar paths become blocked.
How does the brain solve these harder problems?
How does our internal cognitive map not just record our position, but track where food is and where home is, even as everything shifts?

The problem of navigation in a dynamic environment, is the original problem presented to the brain. 
This is the origin of intelligence. 
Intelligence *is* navigation.

I believe that the computational challenges of navigation in a dynamic environment represent the minimum set required for general intelligence to emerge. 
Spatial intelligence is the foundation from which all other forms of intelligence emerge.
If we can solve spatial intelligence, then we can solve general intelligence. 

I believe this is the correct pathway towards Artificial General Intelligence, by solving the problem of Spatial Intelligence. 

This is the Spatial Hypothesis of Intelligence.
