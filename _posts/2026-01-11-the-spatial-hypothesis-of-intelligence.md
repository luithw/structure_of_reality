# The Spatial Hypothesis of Intelligence

I move, therefore I think. 

This is why the brain exists.
The brain exists so that animals can move, and that's why plants don't have brains. 

Why do we need a brain in order to move,  you might ask.
Because we don't just move randomly. 
Movement is tiring, it expends energy. 
That's why we only move "when we have to".
But what does it mean by "when we have to". 
This is a value function. 
We usually move because we need to find food.
And we move in order to avoid being food. 
To forage and to avoid threats. 

This is why animals evolved to move. 
And that's why the brain evolved to work out when to move. 
How to move.
And most importantly, where to move to. 

I believe this is why intelligence is developed.
Intelligence is developed so that we can move effectively across space. 
To better find food, and better avoid prey.

That's how animals evolved first by tracing simple chemical gradients. 
To the ability to effectively navigate in space.
Out of the three fundamental questions of biological intelligence, when, how, and where to move. 
The question of where is the most computationally demanding. 
Because in order to know where to move to, an animal needs to develop an internal map of the space around them. 
This map tells the animal where it is, where the food is, and where is home. 
This map is never static, because the environment is always changing. 
This demands the biological brain to learn a map that can dynamically update itself to match the speed of the changes of the environment.
The biological brain needs to be able to learn how the environment changes fast enough so that it can navigate in the dynamic environment effectively. 

One of the greatest findings in neuroscience of the 20th century is the discovery of the place cell.
The scientist, John O'Keefe, discovered that some neurons in the hippocampus only fire when their rats navigate to a specific location in their arena.
They ruled out other hypotheses of what those cells are doing.

Because it was never clear whether these neurons were really encoding space, or merely responding to specific sensory cues, movements, or moments in time.
He ruled out these alternatives by showing that place-cell firing stays locked to a location even when visual cues, smells, lighting, behavior, or timing change.
The same neuron fires in the same place across different actions, pauses, and delays, yet can completely remap when the environment itself changes.
What remains invariant is not a feature or a sequence, but where the animal is.
This stability at the population level revealed the hippocampus as a true spatial map — a coordinate system onto which experience is organized.

This discovery is profound, because this is the first time that it is demonstrated that a learning system is physically grounded to a fixed location in space, as best as the sensory system can capture.
The biological brain can solve the computationally hard problem of localization in a dynamic environment. 

This was the key problem my PhD thesis investigated. 
To build computational models of how place cells are emerged, and where the same models can localize accurately in a real world dynamic environment. 
I think I succeeded, I built a vision-based computational model that can localize in a dynamic environment with pedestrian traffic as accurately as a smartphone GPS.
This model is developed from the intuition from my advisor, Prof. Jeff Krichmar, of one of the key computational problems of the brain.
This computational problem is the problem of viewpoint transformation of the same location in space. 
We found that a Variational Auto-encoder trained on the objective of perspective transformation developed the same spatial cell types found in the brain such as place cells. 
Then we put this VAE model on a Jackal robot and my Tesla Model 3, by collecting data from their cameras, paired with ground truth from an RTK-GPS.
We call these models Spatial Temporal Reasoning Models. 

My PhD got me thinking deeper about this problem of localization in a dynamic environment.
It is only one of the many computational problems that the biological brain must solve in order to navigate in the dynamic environment. 
You first need to know where you are, before you even know where to find food, and where is your home.
How does the brain solve the rest of these problems?
How does our internal cognitive map record where the food is, and where is home?
When the location of the food keeps changing?

I believe that the most fundamental problem that the biological brain is solving, is the problem of navigation in the dynamic environment.
This is the original question presented to the brain. 
This is where the origin of intelligence is. 

This means that if we can solve the problem of spatial intelligence, then we can solve general intelligence.
The computational problems and the computational demand presented to the biological brain in order to solve the problem of navigation in a dynamic environment, represent the minimum set of evaluation required for general intelligence to emerge. 

I believe this is one of the paths to Artificial General Intelligence, by solving the problem of Spatial Intelligence. 

This is the Spatial Hypothesis of Intelligence.
