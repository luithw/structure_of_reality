# What is Structure of Reality?

What is the structure of reality?

This is the question that the biological brain is asking. The brain exists to predict the dynamic environment. It builds models of reality so that animals can better navigate their surroundings and make predictions that enhance their survival advantage.

This fundamental question, what is the structure of reality, is also what inspired the name of this journal: *Structure of Reality*.

This is one of my own "chain of thoughts" on the origin of intelligence. Intelligence evolved to allow animals to better navigate the dynamic environment. But what exactly is this origin? Or rather, a better question is, where exactly is the origin of intelligence?

*Structure of Reality* is a personal journal of my journey navigating to the origin of intelligence.
I will record my own findings on this journey. 
I want to find out how intelligence is developed. 
What are the underlying computational principles of intelligence?
I will use the scientific method to this end.
Computation is my path to this scientific journey.

I am a Chinese American computer scientist, navigating to the origin of intelligence.
